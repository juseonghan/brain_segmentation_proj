Project II: Multi-Atlas Brain Segmentation And Age Prediction

The ultimate goal of this project is to build machine learning models for predicting age from
brain MR images. You need to approach the goal step by step. From skull stripping to image
registration, and from segmentation to feature extraction, you will gain much hands-on experience
in medical image analysis through this project.
